#  DHCP vs Static IP – Study Notes

When assigning IP addresses to devices, you can use **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** or **Static IP Addressing**. Each method has its strengths depending on the use case.

---

##  Definitions

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **DHCP** | A protocol that automatically assigns IP addresses and other network settings to devices |
| **Static IP** | Manually configured IP address that does not change unless edited by an admin |

---

##  DHCP – Dynamic IP Addressing

-  Assigned automatically by DHCP server (e.g., router, firewall)
-  Includes IP, subnet mask, gateway, DNS, lease time
-  IPs may change over time (lease expiration or reboot)

###  When to Use:
- End-user devices (laptops, phones)
- Temporary or roaming hosts
- Large networks for easier management

---

##  Static IP Addressing

-  Manually configured and permanently assigned
-  Requires admin knowledge of subnet, gateway, DNS
-  IP does not change unless modified

###  When to Use:
- Servers (DNS, web, mail)
- Network infrastructure (routers, switches, firewalls)
- Printers or devices that need to be reachable consistently

##  Comparison Table

| Feature | DHCP | Static IP |
|---------|------|-----------|
| Configuration | Automatic | Manual |
| Flexibility | High | Low |
| Stability | Can change | Fixed |
| Admin Overhead | Low | High |
| Best For | Clients, phones, general hosts | Servers, network devices |

##  VyOS Interface Config Examples

### Static IP
```
set interfaces ethernet eth0 address 192.168.1.10/24
set protocols static route 0.0.0.0/0 next-hop 192.168.1.1
```

###  DHCP Client (VyOS Example)
```
set interfaces ethernet eth0 address dhcp
```

##  Pitfalls to Watch Out For

|  Mistake                          | 🔍 Result                                         |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Static IP conflict with DHCP pool  | IP collisions on the network                     |
| Forgot default gateway             | No internet access                               |
| DHCP server down                   | Clients can't get IPs                            |
| Wrong subnet mask                  | Hosts appear reachable but can't talk            |


###  Both methods are essential in networking — DHCP simplifies, while static ensures consistency. Use each wisely depending on your lab or production design.
